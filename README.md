1. Copy or write down the **IPv4 Public IP** address of the instance.

When the status of the newly launched instance switches to green (Running), you are ready to connect to it.
  * Allow about 10 seconds for the instance to get in the 'running' state. 
  * If needed, click the **Refresh** icon (![Refresh](./images/setup/refresh2.png?raw=true)) in the top-right corner of the EC2 Console to update the instance status information.

#### Connect to your instance using a remote desktop client

The instance you just started is preconfigured with remote desktop protocol (RDP) services.

1. From your local machine, start a remote desktop protocol client
    - On Windows: press the Windows key and type "remote desktop".
      - You should see the "Remote Desktop Connection" in the list of programs.
      - Alternatively you can also simply type `mstsc.exe` in the Windows run prompt.
    - On Linux: RDP clients such a Remmina or Vinagre are suitable.
    - On macOS: use the Microsoft Remote Desktop v8.0.43 (that version offers color depth settings) from the Mac App Store.
1. **IMPORTANT**: Set your RDP client to use **24-bit for color depth**
    - On Windows: In the bottom-left corner of connection prompt, click Options, then select the Display tab and set Colors to True Colors (24 bit)
1. In the RDP client, enter the **IPv4 Public IP** of your instance.
1. Click **Connect**. This should bring up a message about connection certificates. 
1. Click **Yes** to dismiss the message. The Remote Desktop Connection window opens with a login prompt.
1. Login with the following credentials:
    - User: **centos**
    - Password: **sdaccel_labs**   
1. Click **Ok**.

You should now be connected to the remote F1 instance running Centos 7 and SDAccel AWS F1 Developer Labs AMI.

#### Open the lab instructions on the remote F1 instance

1. In the remote instance, double click on the **Chromium** icon.
    - It opens the browser and loads the lab instructions.
    - Note: if a "keyring" popup comes up, click Cancel.
1. Continue following the lab instructions from within the remote instance and the Chromium browser.
    - We suggest you perform all your copy-paste from the instructions to the shell within the RDP session to avoid issues.

#### Download the Developer Labs contents

1. Open a new terminal by right-clicking anywhere in the Desktop area and selecting **Open Terminal**.
1. In the terminal, 'git clone' the SDAccel-AWS-F1-Developer repository to download the files for the Xilinx Developer Lab.
    ```bash  
    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/SDAccel-AWS-F1-Developer-Labs.git
    ```

You instance is now configured to run the SDAccel Developer labs on AWS F1. The next step is to run the "helloworld" example to confirm everything works correctly.
